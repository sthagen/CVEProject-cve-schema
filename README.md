# Current Version of CVE Record Format

Major changes to cve-schema repo architecture!! if you have integrations that rely on the cve-schema repo structure, please review the changes here. The latest version of the CVE JSON record format is 5.1.0. A single schema file with bundled dependencies is available [here](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/docs/CVE_Record_Format_bundled.json).

Note: The CVE Record Format now supports Authorized Data Publisher (ADP) containers there is one active ADP currently.  The CVE Program uses a separate ADP container to provide additional CVE information (e.g., references) for some records. Access this README.md page [here](
https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/blob/main/README.md)
for more information about the CVE Program Container.

Note: Please refer to the CVE Services page [here](https://www.cve.org/AllResources/CveServices) for known issues with the schema. 

# CVE Record Format Overview

cve-schema specifies the CVE record format. This is the blueprint for a rich set of JSON data that can be submitted by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) and Authorized Data Publishers (ADPs) to describe a CVE record. Some examples of CVE record data include CVE ID number, affected product(s), affected version(s), and public references. While those specific items are required when assigning a CVE, there are many other optional data in the schema that can be used to enrich CVE records for community benefit.
